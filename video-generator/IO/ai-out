Cats are fascinating creatures with secrets you might not know. Here are the top five cat facts.  

First, cats have a unique grooming tool—their tongues are covered in tiny, hook-like structures that help them clean fur efficiently.  

Second, a cat’s purring isn’t just for happiness—it can also signal pain or stress, acting as a self-soothing mechanism.  

Third, their whiskers are highly sensitive, detecting changes in air currents to navigate tight spaces and judge distances.  

Fourth, cats sleep up to 16 hours a day because their bodies are wired for short bursts of high-energy activity, like hunting.  

Finally, the oldest known pet cat existed over 9,500 years ago—proof that humans and cats have shared a bond for millennia.
