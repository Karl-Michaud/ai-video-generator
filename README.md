# üé¨ AI Video Generator

This repository contains an **AI Video Generator**, a C-based tool that automates short-form content video creation using AI. It includes standalone programs for AI prompting, text-to-speech, subtitle generation, and audio/video merging; all combined in one master program for content generation.

This master program is ideal for creating quick AI-powered video content without any subscriptions or extra tools. Just write an idea, confirm the script, and let it do the rest. üöÄ

## üìñ Overview

This project includes **4 standalone programs** and **1 master program**:

1. Each **standalone program** can be used independently for its specific functionality.
2. The **master program** (`prompt-to-video.c`) ties everything together into an automated AI-powered video generation pipeline.

Originally made to avoid overpriced tools and test my C skills, this project uses:
- **C** as the primary language
- Some **Python** for JSON parsing
- System calls like `read`, `write`, `dup2`, `pipe`, `execl`, `fork`, and more


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

### üìã Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- `python3`
- `gcc` compiler
- A terminal or shell (Zsh or Bash)
- Homebrew
> ‚úÖ macOS is **HIGHLY** recommended. Other operating systems will require adjustments.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd video-generator
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
make install
```

This installs:

- `ffmpeg` ‚Äì for video/audio processing
- `curl` ‚Äì for HTTP requests

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Homebrew (for macOS)

### Step 3: Add Your DeepSeek API Key

Edit the `Makefile` and replace:

```make
KEY = "PLACEHOLDER"
```

with:

```make
KEY = "your-api-key-here"
```

### Step 4: Export Required Paths

If you're using Zsh (macOS default):

```bash
make setup-env
source ~/.zshrc
```

If you're using Bash:

Uncomment the Bash lines in the `setup-env` section of the Makefile, then run:

```bash
make setup-env
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 5: Build All Executables

```bash
make all
```

This compiles all the programs:

- `text_to_audio`
- `http-request`
- `add-subs`
- `merge-audio`
- `prompt-to-video`

You're now ready to use the tools individually or together through `prompt-to-video`.

## üß± Standalone Programs

This project includes **four standalone programs** that can be used independently or as part of the master program `prompt-to-video.c`:

### 1. `http-request.c`
Prompts DeepSeek AI directly from the terminal. It parses the JSON response and saves only the AI's generated text into a file called `ai-out`.

> üîπ Usage:  
> `./http-request`

### 2. `text_to_audio.c`
Converts a text file into an audio file. You can choose between `.aiff`, `.mp3`, or `.wav` formats using flags.

> üîπ Usage:  
> `./text_to_audio -[flag] input_text_file`  
> (Use `no flag` for `.aiff`, `-mmp3` for `.mp3`, `-wav` for `.wav`)  
> Default (AIFF):  
> `./text_to_audio input_text_file`

### 3. `add-subs.c`
Burns subtitles onto a video. It uses the Whisper model to generate a `.srt` file, converts it to `.ass`, and overlays it on the video.

> üîπ Usage:  
> `./add-subs input_video.mp4 output_video.mp4`

### 4. `merge-audio.c`
Merges an audio file onto a video and automatically truncates the video to match the audio length.

> üîπ Usage:  
> `./merge-audio input_audio input_video output_video`


## üõ† Master Program

The `prompt-to-video` program is the all-in-one tool that automates the creation of short-form AI-generated videos. It combines all standalone programs:

- `http-request.c` to generate the video script via DeepSeek AI
- `text_to_audio.c` to convert the script into audio
- `merge-audio.c` to overlay the audio on a background video (and auto-truncate)
- `add-subs.c` to generate subtitles and burn them onto the video

No manual steps are required once you confirm the AI-generated script ‚Äî the video is fully created with voiceover and subtitles in one shot.

### Running the Program

There are **two ways to run** `prompt-to-video`:

#### 1. Default Background Video

```bash
./prompt-to-video
```

To use this method, you **must define the `DEFAULT_VIDEO` macro** at the top of `prompt-to-video.c`:

```c
#define DEFAULT_VIDEO "path/to/background-video.mp4"
```

> Don't forget to recompile after editing:
```bash
make prompt-to-video
```

#### 2. Specify a Background Video Manually

```bash
./prompt-to-video path/to/background-video.mp4
```

This method lets you pick any video file on the fly.

### Generated Video

‚ö†Ô∏è The final video will be saved automatically in the `/video-generator/videos` directory.
