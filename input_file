"April 28, 2025—Canada heads to the polls in a pivotal federal election. Former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, now 91, actively campaigns for Liberal leader Mark Carney, aiming to replicate his 1993 landslide victory. The election's dynamics are influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump's adversarial stance toward Canada, including threats of annexation and increased auto tariffs. These tensions have shifted voter sentiment, particularly in Ontario, bolstering Liberal support. Carney's platform focuses on economic growth, cost-of-living issues, and green energy initiatives. As the nation votes, the outcome will shape Canada's political landscape for years to come.
